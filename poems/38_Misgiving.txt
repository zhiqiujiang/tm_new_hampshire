MISGIVING


  All crying “We will go with you, O Wind!”
  The foliage follow him, leaf and stem;
  But a sleep oppresses them as they go,
  And they end by bidding him stay with them.

  Since ever they flung abroad in spring
  The leaves had promised themselves this flight,
  Who now would fain seek sheltering wall,
  Or thicket, or hollow place for the night.

  And now they answer his summoning blast
  With an ever vaguer and vaguer stir,
  Or at utmost a little reluctant whirl
  That drops them no further than where they were.

  I only hope that when I am free
  As they are free to go in quest
  Of the knowledge beyond the bounds of life
  It may not seem better to me to rest.
