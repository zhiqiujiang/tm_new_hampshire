LOOKING FOR A SUNSET BIRD IN WINTER


  The west was getting out of gold,
  The breath of air had died of cold,
  When shoeing home across the white,
  I thought I saw a bird alight.

  In summer when I passed the place
  I had to stop and lift my face;
  A bird with an angelic gift
  Was singing in it sweet and swift.

  No bird was singing in it now.
  A single leaf was on a bough,
  And that was all there was to see
  In going twice around the tree.

  From my advantage on a hill
  I judged that such a crystal chill
  Was only adding frost to snow
  As gilt to gold that wouldn’t show.

  A brush had left a crooked stroke
  Of what was either cloud or smoke
  From north to south across the blue;
  A piercing little star was through.
