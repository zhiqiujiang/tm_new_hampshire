AN EMPTY THREAT


  I stay;
  But it isn’t as if
  There wasn’t always Hudson’s Bay
  And the fur trade,
  A small skiff
  And a paddle blade.

  I can just see my tent pegged,
  And me on the floor,
  Crosslegged,
  And a trapper looking in at the door
  With furs to sell.

  His name’s Joe,
  Alias John,
  And between what he doesn’t know
  And won’t tell
  About where Henry Hudson’s gone,
  I can’t say he’s much help;
  But we get on.

  The seal yelp
  On an ice cake.
  It’s not men by some mistake?

  No,
  There’s not a soul
  For a wind-break
  Between me and the North Pole—

  Except always John-Joe,
  My French Indian Esquimaux,
  And he’s off setting traps,
  In one himself perhaps.

  Give a head shake
  Over so much bay
  Thrown away
  In snow and mist
  That doesn’t exist,
  I was going to say,
  For God, man or beast’s sake,
  Yet does perhaps for all three.

  Don’t ask Joe
  What it is to him.
  It’s sometimes dim
  What it is to me,
  Unless it be
  It’s the old captain’s dark fate
  Who failed to find or force a strait
  In its two-thousand-mile coast;
  And his crew left him where he failed,
  And nothing came of all he sailed.

  It’s to say, “You and I”
  To such a ghost,
  “You and I
  Off here
  With the dead race of the Great Auk!”
  And, “Better defeat almost,
  If seen clear,
  Than life’s victories of doubt
  That need endless talk talk
  To make them out.”
