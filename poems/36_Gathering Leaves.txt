GATHERING LEAVES


  Spades take up leaves
  No better than spoons,
  And bags full of leaves
  Are light as balloons.

  I make a great noise
  Of rustling all day
  Like rabbit and deer
  Running away.

  But the mountains I raise
  Elude my embrace,
  Flowing over my arms
  And into my face.

  I may load and unload
  Again and again
  Till I fill the whole shed,
  And what have I then?

  Next to nothing for weight;
  And since they grew duller
  From contact with earth,
  Next to nothing for color.

  Next to nothing for use.
  But a crop is a crop,
  And who’s to say where
  The harvest shall stop?
