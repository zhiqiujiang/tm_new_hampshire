THE ONSET


  Always the same, when on a fated night
  At last the gathered snow lets down as white
  As may be in dark woods, and with a song
  It shall not make again all winter long
  Of hissing on the yet uncovered ground,
  I almost stumble looking up and round,
  As one who overtaken by the end
  Gives up his errand, and lets death descend
  Upon him where he is, with nothing done
  To evil, no important triumph won,
  More than if life had never been begun.

  Yet all the precedent is on my side:
  I know that winter death has never tried
  The earth but it has failed: the snow may heap
  In long storms an undrifted four feet deep
  As measured against maple, birch and oak,
  It cannot check the peeper’s silver croak;
  And I shall see the snow all go down hill
  In water of a slender April rill
  That flashes tail through last year’s withered brake
  And dead weeds, like a disappearing snake.
  Nothing will be left white but here a birch,
  And there a clump of houses with a church.
