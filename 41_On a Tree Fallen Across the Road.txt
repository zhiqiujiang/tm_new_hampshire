ON A TREE FALLEN ACROSS THE ROAD
                         (_To hear us talk_)


  The tree the tempest with a crash of wood
  Throws down in front of us is not to bar
  Our passage to our journey’s end for good,
  But just to ask us who we think we are

  Insisting always on our own way so.
  She likes to halt us in our runner tracks,
  And make us get down in a foot of snow
  Debating what to do without an axe.

  And yet she knows obstruction is in vain:
  We will not be put off the final goal
  We have it hidden in us to attain,
  Not though we have to seize earth by the pole

  And, tired of aimless circling in one place,
  Steer straight off after something into space.
