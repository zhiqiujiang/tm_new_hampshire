THE AXE-HELVE


  I’ve known ere now an interfering branch
  Of alder catch my lifted axe behind me.
  But that was in the woods, to hold my hand
  From striking at another alder’s roots,
  And that was, as I say, an alder branch.
  This was a man, Baptiste, who stole one day
  Behind me on the snow in my own yard
  Where I was working at the chopping-block,
  And cutting nothing not cut down already.
  He caught my axe expertly on the rise,
  When all my strength put forth was in his favor,
  Held it a moment where it was, to calm me,
  Then took it from me—and I let him take it.
  I didn’t know him well enough to know
  What it was all about. There might be something
  He had in mind to say to a bad neighbor
  He might prefer to say to him disarmed.
  But all he had to tell me in French-English
  Was what he thought of—not me, but my axe;
  Me only as I took my axe to heart.
  It was the bad axe-helve some one had sold me—
  “Made on machine,” he said, ploughing the grain
  With a thick thumbnail to show how it ran
  Across the handle’s long drawn serpentine,
  Like the two strokes across a dollar sign.
  “You give her one good crack, she’s snap raght off.
  Den where’s your hax-ead flying t’rough de hair?”
  Admitted; and yet, what was that to him?

  “Come on my house and I put you one in
  What’s las’ awhile—good hick’ry what’s grow crooked,
  De second growt’ I cut myself—tough, tough!”

  Something to sell? That wasn’t how it sounded.

  “Den when you say you come? It’s cost you nothing.
  To-naght?”

            As well to-night as any night.

  Beyond an over-warmth of kitchen stove
  My welcome differed from no other welcome.
  Baptiste knew best why I was where I was.
  So long as he would leave enough unsaid,
  I shouldn’t mind his being overjoyed
  (If overjoyed he was) at having got me
  Where I must judge if what he knew about an axe
  That not everybody else knew was to count
  For nothing in the measure of a neighbor.
  Hard if, though cast away for life with Yankees,
  A Frenchman couldn’t get his human rating!

  Mrs. Baptiste came in and rocked a chair
  That had as many motions as the world:
  One back and forward, in and out of shadow,
  That got her nowhere; one more gradual,
  Sideways, that would have run her on the stove
  In time, had she not realized her danger
  And caught herself up bodily, chair and all,
  And set herself back where she started from.
  “She ain’t spick too much Henglish—dat’s too bad.”

  I was afraid, in brightening first on me,
  Then on Baptiste, as if she understood
  What passed between us, she was only feigning.
  Baptiste was anxious for her; but no more
  Than for himself, so placed he couldn’t hope
  To keep his bargain of the morning with me
  In time to keep me from suspecting him
  Of really never having meant to keep it.

  Needlessly soon he had his axe-helves out,
  A quiverful to choose from, since he wished me
  To have the best he had, or had to spare—
  Not for me to ask which, when what he took
  Had beauties he had to point me out at length
  To insure their not being wasted on me.
  He liked to have it slender as a whipstock,
  Free from the least knot, equal to the strain
  Of bending like a sword across the knee.
  He showed me that the lines of a good helve
  Were native to the grain before the knife
  Expressed them, and its curves were no false curves
  Put on it from without. And there its strength lay
  For the hard work. He chafed its long white body
  From end to end with his rough hand shut round it.
  He tried it at the eye-hole in the axe-head.
  “Hahn, hahn,” he mused, “don’t need much taking down.”
  Baptiste knew how to make a short job long
  For love of it, and yet not waste time either.

  Do you know, what we talked about was knowledge?
  Baptiste on his defence about the children
  He kept from school, or did his best to keep—
  Whatever school and children and our doubts
  Of laid-on education had to do
  With the curves of his axe-helves and his having
  Used these unscrupulously to bring me
  To see for once the inside of his house.
  Was I desired in friendship, partly as some one
  To leave it to, whether the right to hold
  Such doubts of education should depend
  Upon the education of those who held them?

  But now he brushed the shavings from his knee
  And stood the axe there on its horse’s hoof,
  Erect, but not without its waves, as when
  The snake stood up for evil in the Garden,—
  Top-heavy with a heaviness his short,
  Thick hand made light of, steel-blue chin drawn down
  And in a little—a French touch in that.
  Baptiste drew back and squinted at it, pleased;
  “See how she’s cock her head!”
