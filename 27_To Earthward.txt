TO EARTHWARD


  Love at the lips was touch
  As sweet as I could bear;
  And once that seemed too much;
  I lived on air

  That crossed me from sweet things,
  The flow of—was it musk
  From hidden grapevine springs
  Down hill at dusk?

  I had the swirl and ache
  From sprays of honeysuckle
  That when they’re gathered shake
  Dew on the knuckle.

  I craved strong sweets, but those
  Seemed strong when I was young;
  The petal of the rose
  It was that stung.

  Now no joy but lacks salt
  That is not dashed with pain
  And weariness and fault;
  I crave the stain

  Of tears, the aftermark
  Of almost too much love,
  The sweet of bitter bark
  And burning clove.

  When stiff and sore and scarred
  I take away my hand
  From leaning on it hard
  In grass and sand,

  The hurt is not enough:
  I long for weight and strength
  To feel the earth as rough
  To all my length.
