I WILL SING YOU ONE-O


  It was long I lay
  Awake that night
  Wishing the tower
  Would name the hour
  And tell me whether
  To call it day
  (Though not yet light)
  And give up sleep.
  The snow fell deep
  With the hiss of spray;
  Two winds would meet,
  One down one street,
  One down another,
  And fight in a smother
  Of dust and feather.
  I could not say,
  But feared the cold
  Had checked the pace
  Of the tower clock
  By tying together
  Its hands of gold
  Before its face.

  Then came one knock!
  A note unruffled
  Of earthly weather,
  Though strange and muffled.
  The tower said, “One!”
  And then a steeple.
  They spoke to themselves
  And such few people
  As winds might rouse
  From sleeping warm
  (But not unhouse).
  They left the storm
  That struck _en masse_
  My window glass
  Like a beaded fur.
  In that grave One
  They spoke of the sun
  And moon and stars,
  Saturn and Mars
  And Jupiter.
  Still more unfettered,
  They left the named
  And spoke of the lettered,
  The sigmas and taus
  Of constellations.
  They filled their throats
  With the furthest bodies
  To which man sends his
  Speculation,
  Beyond which God is;
  The cosmic motes
  Of yawning lenses.
  Their solemn peals
  Were not their own:
  They spoke for the clock
  With whose vast wheels
  Theirs interlock.

  In that grave word
  Uttered alone
  The utmost star
  Trembled and stirred,
  Though set so far
  Its whirling frenzies
  Appear like standing
  In one self station.
  It has not ranged,
  And save for the wonder
  Of once expanding
  To be a nova,
  It has not changed
  To the eye of man
  On planets over
  Around and under
  It in creation
  Since man began
  To drag down man
  And nation nation.
