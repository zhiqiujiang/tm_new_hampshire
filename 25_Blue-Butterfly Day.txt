BLUE-BUTTERFLY DAY


  It is blue-butterfly day here in spring,
  And with these sky-flakes down in flurry on flurry
  There is more unmixed color on the wing
  Than flowers will show for days unless they hurry.

  But these are flowers that fly and all but sing:
  And now from having ridden out desire
  They lie closed over in the wind and cling
  Where wheels have freshly sliced the April mire.
