THE LOCKLESS DOOR


  It went many years,
  But at last came a knock,
  And I thought of the door
  With no lock to lock.

  I blew out the light,
  I tip-toed the floor,
  And raised both hands
  In prayer to the door.

  But the knock came again.
  My window was wide;
  I climbed on the sill
  And descended outside.

  Back over the sill
  I bade a “Come in”
  To whatever the knock
  At the door may have been.

  So at a knock
  I emptied my cage
  To hide in the world
  And alter with age.
