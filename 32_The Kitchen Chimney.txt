THE KITCHEN CHIMNEY


  Builder, in building the little house,
  In every way you may please yourself;
  But please please me in the kitchen chimney:
  Don’t build me a chimney upon a shelf.

  However far you must go for bricks,
  Whatever they cost a-piece or a pound,
  Buy me enough for a full-length chimney,
  And build the chimney clear from the ground.

  It’s not that I’m greatly afraid of fire,
  But I never heard of a house that throve
  (And I know of one that didn’t thrive)
  Where the chimney started above the stove.

  And I dread the ominous stain of tar
  That there always is on the papered walls,
  And the smell of fire drowned in rain
  That there always is when the chimney’s false.

  A shelf’s for a clock or vase or picture,
  But I don’t see why it should have to bear
  A chimney that only would serve to remind me
  Of castles I used to build in air.
